== Description ==

**StickyWooCart** is a WooCommerce ajax cart plugin, that allows you to create a side (off-canvas) cart page to improve standard WooCommerce add to cart notice and WooCommerce cart page.

The plugin is built on ajax (no page reloads) to ensure better conversions, provide frictionless shopping and smooth checkout to boost your shop sales.

A floating cart is added to ensure more leads generated, and better Facebook pixel warming, that leads to more conversion events and better ads optimisation.

Enhance the customer experience and increase your conversion rate with a sliding cart preview that can be accessed from anywhere on your WooCommerce store. No need to take your customers to a separate cart page and reduce conversions by extra unnecessary clicks.

When a visitor adds a product to cart, the off-canvas cart page slides-in to provide one-click & express checkout options.

A visitor can adjust product quantity in a cart and immediately start the checkout process with fever clicks resulting in frictionless shopping Amazon-like style.
